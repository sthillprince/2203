### Week 3: Planning/Testing 

This week began with some basic planning and research regarding the solar tracking mechanism. 

It was decided that we would use stepper motors to move our contraption to point towards the sun
throughout the day. Stepper motors are often found in any sort of device that requires very precise
position control, such as CNC machines, 3D printers and more. Since the sun's position will be changing 
at a very slow speed relative to our solar cooker, we will be able to take advantage of the motor's
ability to make extremely small steps. A possible issue with the motors is the power it will take to 
operate them during a day cycle.

During the second half of this week, we conducted tests of a few commercial solar cookers, in order
to get a better sense of how well current methods of converting solar heat to cook food work. 

I worked with others on assembling a larger commercial solar cooker,

while other groups set up a smaller commercial cooker.

Although we were unable to test the effectiveness of the largest solar cooker, we still conducted
tests on both a cheap cooker, and a slightly more expensive one by measuring the temperature of
water in each device after being left out in the sun for about 30 minutes.

We found that the more expensive cooker performed better, heating the water to a temperature 
of about 47 degrees Celsius in 30 minutes, compared to the cheaper cooker which heated the
water to a temperature of 39.9 degrees Celsius in about 30 minutes.

In the more expensive yellow cooker, it was observed that the water seemed to be heating up
linearly with time, and the black pot inside the cooker was hot to the touch after half an hour.
