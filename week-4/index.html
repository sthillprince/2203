### Week 4: CAD Learning and Planning 

This week was focused on creating the CAD for the Fresnel Reflector array that could be used to reflect sunlight for our solar cooker, in the event that a parabolic reflector cannot be created. 

Last year, the array support consisted of small acrylic pieces hot glued together. This was found to be very time-consuming, and also too weak to give ample support to the reflector array.

This year, we will be machining down foam into our desired shape, and then adding the reflector pieces after we have our support surface created. This should be a far less tedious process, and also should provide more reliable support.

I started off the week by creating a few models in Fusion 360, to help adjust to the new software.

I created this lego block:

And this bookholder:

The remainder of the week was spent discussing the possible ways to create the CAD of the support structure, including discussions on where we might place the focal point of the entire contraption and how this would affect the design of the structure.

We also were able to get a short lesson on how to set up tool paths, and get a preview of how our support structure would
actually be created in real time.
