### Week 2: More Introduction and Brainstorming 

This week, we received basic information about the different aspects of this project we could focus on. The part of the project
I found the most interesting was the solar-tracking mechanism. This mechanism will ensure that our device is always pointed at
the sun, in order to absorb as much energy as possible.

We can render mp4 videos by writing: 

```
<video controls>
  <source src="./demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
```

Which should render like: 

<video controls>
  <source src="./demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
